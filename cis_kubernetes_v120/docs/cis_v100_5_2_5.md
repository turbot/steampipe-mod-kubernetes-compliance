## Description

Do not generally permit containers to be run with the **allowPrivilegeEscalation** flag set
to **true**.

A container running with the allowPrivilegeEscalation flag set to true may have
processes that can gain more privileges than their parent.

There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit
containers to allow privilege escalation. The option exists (and is defaulted to true) to
permit setuid binaries to run.

If you have need to run containers which use setuid binaries or require privilege escalation,
this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to
ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that
PSP.

## Remediation

Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the **.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation** field is **omitted** or set to **false**.
