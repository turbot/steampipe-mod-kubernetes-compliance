## Description

Explicitly set a service account private key file for service accounts on the controller manager.

To ensure that keys for service account tokens can be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. The private key should be specified to the controller manager with `--service-account-privatekey-file` as appropriate.

## Remediation

Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kubecontroller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--service-accountprivate-key-file` parameter to the private key file for service accounts.

```yaml
--service-account-private-key-file=<filename>
```

**Default Value:** By default, `--service-account-private-key-file` it not set.
