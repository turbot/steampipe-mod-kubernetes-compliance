## Description

Disable the read-only port.

The Kubelet process provides a read-only API in addition to the main Kubelet API. Unauthenticated access is provided to this read-only API which could possibly retrieve potentially sensitive information about the cluster.

## Remediation

If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `readOnlyPort` to `0`.

If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.

```yaml
--read-only-port=0
```

Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:

```yaml
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
```

**Default Value:** By default, `--read-only-port` is set to `10255/TCP`. However, if a config file is specified by `--config` the default value for `readOnlyPort` is 0.
