## Description

Configure TLS encryption for the etcd service.

etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit.

## Remediation

Follow the etcd service documentation and configure TLS encryption. Then, edit the etcd pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml on the master node and set the below parameters.
```yaml
--cert-file=</path/to/ca-file>
--key-file=</path/to/key-file>
```

**Default Value:** By default, TLS encryption is not set.
