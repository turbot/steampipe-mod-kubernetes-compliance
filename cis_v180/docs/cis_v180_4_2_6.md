## Description

Allow Kubelet to manage iptables

Kubelets can automatically manage the required changes to iptables based on how you choose your networking options for the pods. It is recommended to let kubelets manage the changes to iptables. This ensures that the iptables configuration remains in sync with pods networking configuration. Manually configuring iptables with dynamic pod network configuration changes might hamper the communication between pods/containers and to the outside world. You might have iptables rules too restrictive or too open.

## Remediation

If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `makeIPTablesUtilChains: true.`

If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and remove the `--makeiptables-util-chains` argument from the `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable. Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:

Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:
```yaml
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
```

**Default Value:** By default, `--make-iptables-util-chains` argument is set to `true.`
