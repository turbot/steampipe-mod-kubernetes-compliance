## Description

Do not always authorize all requests.

The API Server, can be configured to allow all requests. This mode should not be used on any production cluster.


## Remediation

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kubeapiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to values other than AlwaysAllow. One such example could be as below.
```yaml
--authorization-mode=RBAC
```

**Default Value:** By default, `AlwaysAllow` is not enabled.
