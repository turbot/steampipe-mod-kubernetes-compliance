## Description

Automate service accounts management

When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the default service account in the same namespace. You should create your own service account and let the API server manage its security tokens.

## Remediation

Follow the documentation and create `ServiceAccount` objects as per your environment. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kubeapiserver.yaml` on the master node and ensure that the `--disable-admission-plugins` parameter is set to a value that does not include `ServiceAccount.`

**Default Value:** By default, `ServiceAccount` is set.
