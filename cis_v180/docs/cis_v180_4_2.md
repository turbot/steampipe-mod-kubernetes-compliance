## Overview

This section contains recommendations for kubelet configuration.

Kubelet settings may be configured using arguments on the running kubelet executable, or they may be taken from a Kubelet config file. If both are specified, the executable argument takes precedence.

To find the Kubelet config file, run the following command:

```yaml
ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep config
```

If the `--config` argument is present, this gives the location of the Kubelet config file.
This config file could be in JSON or YAML format depending on your distribution.
