## Description

Do not allow all requests. Enable explicit authorization.

Kubelets, by default, allow all authenticated requests (even anonymous ones) without needing explicit authorization checks from the apiserver. You should restrict this behavior and only allow explicitly authorized requests.

## Remediation

If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set authorization: mode to Webhook. If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS` variable.

```yaml
--authorization-mode=Webhook
```
Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:
```yaml
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
```

**Default Value:** By default, `--authorization-mode` argument is set to `AlwaysAllow.`
