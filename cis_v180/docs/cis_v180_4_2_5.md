## Description

Do not disable timeouts on streaming connection.

Setting idle timeouts ensures that you are protected against Denial-of-Service attacks, inactive connections and running out of ephemeral ports.

**Note:** : By default, `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` is set to 4 hours which might be too high for your environment. Setting this as appropriate would additionally ensure that such streaming connections are timed out after serving legitimate use cases.

## Remediation

If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout` to a value other than 0.

If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.

```yaml
--streaming-connection-idle-timeout=5m
```
Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:
```yaml
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
```

**Default Value:** By default, `--streaming-connection-idle-timeou`t` is set to 4 hours.
