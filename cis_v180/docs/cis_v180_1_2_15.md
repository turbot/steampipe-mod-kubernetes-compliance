## Description

Limit the `Node` and `Pod` objects that a kubelet could modify.

Using the `NodeRestriction` plug-in ensures that the kubelet is restricted to the `Node` and `Pod` objects that it could modify as defined. Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own `Node` API object, and only modify `Pod` API objects that are bound to their node.

## Remediation

Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure `NodeRestriction` plug-in on kubelets. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the `-- enable-admission-plugins` parameter to a value that includes` NodeRestriction`.

```yaml
--enable-admission-plugins=...,NodeRestriction,...
```

**Default Value:** By default, `NodeRestriction` is not set.
