## Description

Reject creating objects in a namespace that is undergoing termination.

Setting admission control policy to `NamespaceLifecycle` ensures that objects cannot be created in non-existent namespaces, and that namespaces undergoing termination are not used for creating the new objects. This is recommended to enforce the integrity of the namespace termination process and also for the availability of the newer objects.

## Remediation

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kubeapiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--disable-admission-plugins` parameter to ensure it does not include `NamespaceLifecycle`.

**Default Value:** By default,` NamespaceLifecycle` is set.
