## Description

Do not bind the Controller Manager service to non-loopback insecure addresses.

The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface

## Remediation

Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kubecontroller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and ensure the correct value for the `--bind-address` parameter

**Default Value:** By default, the `--bind-address` parameter is set to 0.0.0.0
