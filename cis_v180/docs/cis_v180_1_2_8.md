## Description

Turn on Role Based Access Control.

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in the cluster. It is recommended to use the RBAC authorization mode.

## Remediation

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kubeapiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to a value that includes `RBAC`, for example:
```yaml
--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
```

**Default Value:** By default, `RBAC` authorization is not enabled.
