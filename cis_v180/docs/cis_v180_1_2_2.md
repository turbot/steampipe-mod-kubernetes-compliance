## Description

Do not use token based authentication.

The token-based authentication utilizes static tokens to authenticate requests to the apiserver. The tokens are stored in clear-text in a file on the apiserver, and cannot be revoked or rotated without restarting the apiserver. Hence, do not use static tokenbased authentication.

## Remediation

Follow the documentation and configure alternate mechanisms for authentication. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kubeapiserver.yaml` on the master node and remove the `--token-auth-file=<filename> `parameter.

**Default Value:** By default, `--token-auth-file` argument is not set.
