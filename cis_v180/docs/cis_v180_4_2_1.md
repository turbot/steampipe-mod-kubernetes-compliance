## Description

Disable anonymous requests to the Kubelet server.

When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the Kubelet server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests.

## Remediation

If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authentication: anonymous: enabled` to false. If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.

```yaml
--anonymous-auth=false
```
Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:
```yaml
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
```

**Default Value:** By default, anonymous access is enabled.
