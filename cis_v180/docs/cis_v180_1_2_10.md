## Description

Do not allow all requests.

Setting admission control plugin `AlwaysAdmit` allows all requests and do not filter any requests.

The `AlwaysAdmit` admission controller was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13. Its behavior was equivalent to turning off all admission controllers.

## Remediation

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kubeapiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and either remove the `--enable-admissionplugins` parameter, or set it to a value that does not include `AlwaysAdmit`.

**Default Value:** `AlwaysAdmit` is not in the list of default admission plugins.
