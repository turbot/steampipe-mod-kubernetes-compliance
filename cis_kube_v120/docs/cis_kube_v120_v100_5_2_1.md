## Description

Do not generally permit containers to be run with the **securityContext.privileged** flag
set to **true**.

Privileged containers have access to all Linux Kernel capabilities and devices. A container
running with full privileges can do almost everything that the host can do. This flag exists
to allow special use-cases, like manipulating the network stack and accessing devices.
There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit
privileged containers.

If you need to run privileged containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you
should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and
users are given permission to access that PSP.

## Remediation

Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the **.spec.privileged** field is **omitted** or set to **false**.
