## Description

Do not generally permit containers to be run as the root user.

Containers may run as any Linux user. Containers which run as the root user, whilst
constrained by Container Runtime security features still have a escalated likelihood of
container breakout.

Ideally, all containers should run as a defined non-UID 0 user.

There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit root
users in a container.

If you need to run root containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should
carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are
given permission to access that PSP.

## Remediation

Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the **.spec.runAsUser.rule** is set to either **MustRunAsNonRoot** or **MustRunAs** with the range of UIDs not including 0.
