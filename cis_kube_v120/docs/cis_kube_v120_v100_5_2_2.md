## Description

Do not generally permit containers to be run with the **hostPID** flag set to **true**.

A container running in the host's PID namespace can inspect processes running outside the
container. If the container also has access to ptrace capabilities this can be used to escalate
privileges outside of the container.

There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit
containers to share the host PID namespace.

If you need to run containers which require hostPID, this should be defined in a separate
PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service
accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP.

## Remediation

Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the **.spec.hostPID** field is **omitted** or set to **false**.
