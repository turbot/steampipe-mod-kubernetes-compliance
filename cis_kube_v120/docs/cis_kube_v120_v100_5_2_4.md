## Description

Do not generally permit containers to be run with the **hostNetwork** flag set to **true**.

A container running in the host's network namespace could access the local loopback
device, and could access network traffic to and from other pods.

There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit
containers to share the host network namespace.

If you have need to run containers which require hostNetwork, this should be defined in a
separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited
service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP.

## Remediation

Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the **.spec.hostNetwork** field is **omitted** or set to **false**.
