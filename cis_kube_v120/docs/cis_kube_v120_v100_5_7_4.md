## Description

Kubernetes provides a default namespace, where objects are placed if no namespace is
specified for them. Placing objects in this namespace makes application of RBAC and other
controls more difficult.

## Remediation

Ensure that namespaces are created to allow for appropriate segregation of Kubernetes
resources and that all new resources are created in a specific namespace.
