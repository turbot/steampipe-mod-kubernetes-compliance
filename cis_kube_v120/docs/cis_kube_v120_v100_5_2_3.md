## Description

Do not generally permit containers to be run with the **hostIPC** flag set to **true**.

A container running in the host's IPC namespace can use IPC to interact with processes
outside the container.

There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit
containers to share the host IPC namespace.

If you have a requirement to containers which require hostIPC, this should be defined in a
separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited
service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP.

## Remediation

Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the **.spec.hostIPC** field is **omitted** or set to **false**.
