  container_disallow_host_path_title = "__KIND__ containers should not allow privilege escalation"
  container_disallow_host_path_desc  = "Containers in a __KIND__ should not able to access any specific paths of the host file system. There are many ways a container with unrestricted access to the host filesystem can escalate privileges, including reading data from other containers, and abusing the credentials of system services, such as Kubelet."

  container_privilege_disabled_title = "__KIND__ containers should not have privileged access"
  container_privilege_disabled_desc  = "Containers in a __KIND__ should not have privileged access. To prevent security issues, it is recommended that you do not run privileged containers in your environment. Instead, provide granular permissions and capabilities to the container environment. Giving containers full access to the host can create security flaws in your production environment."

  container_privilege_escalation_disabled_title = "__KIND__ containers should not allow privilege escalation"
  container_privilege_escalation_disabled_desc  = "Containers in a __KIND__ should not allow privilege escalation.  A container running with the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` flag set to true may have processes that can gain more privileges than their parent."

  host_network_access_disabled_desc  = "Containers in a __KIND__ should not run in the host network of the node where the pod is deployed.  When running on the host network, the pod can use the network namespace and network resources of the node. In this case, the pod can access loopback devices, listen to addresses, and monitor the traffic of other pods on the node."

  hostpid_hostipc_sharing_disabled_desc  = "Containers in a __KIND__ should not share the host process PID or IPC namespace.  Sharing the host’s process namespace allows the container to see all of the processes on the host system. This reduces the benefit of process level isolation between the host and the containers. Under these circumstances a malicious user who has access to a container could get access to processes on the host itself, manipulate them, and even be able to kill them."

An immutable root filesystem can also prevent malicious binaries from writing to the host system."

  non_root_container_desc  = "Containers in a __KIND__ should not run with root privileges. By default, many container services run as the privileged root user, and applications execute inside the container as root despite not requiring privileged execution. Preventing root execution by using non-root containers or a rootless container engine limits the impact of a container compromise."

  service_account_token_disabled_desc = "Automatic mapping of service account token should be disabled. By default, Kubernetes automatically provisions a service account when creating a Pod and mounts the account’s secret token within the Pod at runtime. Many containerized applications do not require direct access to the service account as Kubernetes orchestration occurs transparently in the background. If an application is compromised, account tokens in Pods can be gleaned by cyber actors and used to further compromise the cluster. When an application does not need to access the service account directly, Kubernetes administrators should ensure that Pod specifications disable the secret token being mounted. This can be accomplished using the `automountServiceAccountToken: false` directive in the Pod’s YAML specification."
