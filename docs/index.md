# Kubernetes Compliance Mod

Run individual controls or full compliance benchmarks for `NSA and CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guidance` across all of your Kubernetes clusters.

## References

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

[NSA & CISA Cybersecurity Technical Report](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Aug/03/2002820425/-1/-1/1/CTR_KUBERNETES%20HARDENING%20GUIDANCE.PDF) describes the complexities of securely managing Kubernetes an open-source, container-orchestration system used to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, and codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration.
