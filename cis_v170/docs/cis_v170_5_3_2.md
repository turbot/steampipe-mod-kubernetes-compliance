## Description

Use network policies to isolate traffic in your cluster network.

Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed to. A network policy is a specification of how selections of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints.

Network Policies are namespace scoped. When a network policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not allowed by the policy is denied. However, if there are no network policies in a namespace all traffic will be allowed into and out of the pods in that namespace.

## Remediation

Follow the documentation and create `NetworkPolicy` objects as you need them. By default, network policies are not created.

## Default Value

By default, network policies are not created.
