## Description

Enable `docker/default` seccomp profile in your pod definitions.

Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications
can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads
running in the cluster. Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical
reasons. You should enable it to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available
within the container.

## Remediation

Use security context to enable the docker/default seccomp profile in your pod definitions. An example is as below:

```yaml
securityContext:
  seccompProfile:
    type: RuntimeDefault
```

**Default Value:** By default, seccomp profile is set to unconfined which means that no seccomp profiles are enabled.
