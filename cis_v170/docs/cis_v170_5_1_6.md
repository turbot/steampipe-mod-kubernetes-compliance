## Description

Service accounts tokens should not be mounted in pods except where the workload
running in the pod explicitly needs to communicate with the API server.

Mounting service account tokens inside pods can provide an avenue for privilege escalation
attacks where an attacker is able to compromise a single pod in the cluster.

Avoiding mounting these tokens removes this attack avenue.

## Remediation

Modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service account tokens to disable it.
